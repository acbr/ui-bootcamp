# Instructions

Please follow the instructions here about giving a talk for the AC UI Bootcamp. Should you have any question or suggestion, please make sure you talk to your buddy.

## Steps

1. Get approval / confirmation from the buddies.
1. Pick an attractive, interesting title for your talk. If you can't think on a good name, please ask your buddy a suggestion.
1. Prepare the talk agenda in very clear and well-defined topics, and present it to your buddy.
1. Set up the time for your talk. You can pick max 1h time slot, which currently is 2pm-3pm (before SF starts) or 6pm-7pm (in SF lunch time).
1. Go and register this talk in AC Miles. Feel free to advertise your talk in the company as much as you want :)
1. Set up the a Fuze meeting for your talk. If you don't have access, please ask your buddy for help.
1. Ask on [ui.bootcamp@avenuecode.com](mailto:ui.bootcamp@avenuecode.com) to update our Github repo with your talk. Please provide your GitHub account.
1. Now you should start working on your slide deck, and as soon it is completed, please send an email to [ui.bootcamp@avenuecode.com](mailto:ui.bootcamp@avenuecode.com) with your slide deck link, so that we will fork it within Avenue Code's account.

## Content steps

1. Prepare the content in such way it will last no more than 50 minutes, leaving up to 10 minutes for questions.
1. Prepare an assignment that should take up to 3 hours of work to be delivered. It should not be hard, however not so easy to be completed in 1 hour.
1. Think ahead on how will you correct the assignments. If you think the work load is too heavy for you, please talk to your buddy so that you can look for some help from others.
1. The assignment should be a problem that would be solved using things that were covered on the talk. It is ok to go a little bit far (forcing the attendee to do some research), but that should be optional.
1. If appliable, the assignment could be some problem to be later used by the recruitment team. If that happens, we can create a small contest where the best solution will incorporate the recruitment material and the person who developed will receive a free lunch or some other prize.
1. Give at least 3 reference links to be followed for further studies.

## Slide deck standards

1. Sign up for a free account at [Slid.es](http://slid.es).
1. Fork any slide deck from [Avenue Code's slid.es account](https://slid.es/avenuecode) - this will create a copy of this talk in your personal account, which you can freely change. This approach is recommended because you will get the template featuring the footer with AC logo.
1. Make sure you have read some slide decks from previous AC talks to better understand about how it should be.
1. Be welcome to try a different color/fonts scheme, as long as you keep the same template elements as: AC logo on the right bottom corner, line on the bottom, title below this line.
1. If you prefer starting from scratch instead, make the template yourself, but you must include the following code to each slide's HTML source code to the get the footer with AC logo:

```
<div class="absolute-element" style="position: absolute; width: 719px; height: 46px; z-index: 4; left: 37px; 
  top: 596px; color: #ccc">
    <span>______________________________________________</span>
    <div style="text-align: left; font-size: 24px;">MY LECTURE TITLE GOES HERE</div>
</div>
<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/media-p.slid.es/uploads/avenuecode/images/197088/logo.png" class="absolute-element"
  style="position: absolute; max-height: none; max-width: none; width: 153px; height: 109px; z-index: 4; left: 757px; 
  top: 545px;">
```

## Slide deck organization

1. The 1st slide should always be the cover, featuring your lecture name, your name, the lecture date and AC logo.
1. The 2nd slide should always be the agenda, in topics.
1. The 3nd slide should list the pre-requisites of your talk.
1. From the 4th slide on it should start your content.
1. Every time you have content from a same topic that doesn't fit on the slide, you should expand it VERTICALLY by adding a slide below.
1. Every time the next slide is about a different topic, you should expand it HORIZONTALLY by adding a slide to the right.
1. The 3 last slides should always be: Conclusions, Learn more (with the reference links) and Assignment.

## Talk standards

1. BALANCE CONCEPTS AND TECHNICAL CONTENT. It's a matter of finding the 'sweet spot', where the presenter keeps the subject interesting for everybody, has a good velocity and touches deeper concept details wisely.
1. BE CONSISTENT. Make sure you watched some previous AC talks to better understand about how to use your voice and conduct the talk.
1. BE POLITE. Don't use slangs neither bad words.
1. BE OBJECTIVE. Don't overexplain in such way you could cause confusion to your attendees. 
1. DON'T BE BORING. You should be yourself. It is ok to joke around, but don't exaggerate.
1. KEEP FOCUS. It is ok to bring brief off-topic discussions, but only if it doesn't disturb the natural flow of your content.
1. BE PREPARED. If you are going to use examples or live coding, make sure you have them all prepared beforehand.
1. DON'T BE ARROGANT. Don't focus on yourself, like "you are awesome because you know lots of stuff". You could be Chuck Norris or Yoda, but please remember that people are not watching this talk to know about your adventures. It is ok to talk about something great that you did but just as an illustrative example which is related with the talk subject.
1. DON'T GENERALIZE, specially stuff that you are not sure about. For instance, you can't come and say that Backbone.js is the most robust MV* framework or that SASS is the fastest CSS pre-processor - you would need to prove that, so we would even recommend you not saying such things.
1. USE REAL DATA. Make sure you put trustable references on data you expose. Like, you can't base on your own expertise to say that Backbone.js is used on 60% of the websites that use a MV* framework. You need to prove that with real data and provide a trustable reference on this data.
1. Train your english speaking. You will be listened by people all around the globe.
1. Train your full talk at least once before your talk.

## Tips from UI Bootcamp organizers:

* ENJOY your experience by creating the talk, because you will surely learn MUCH MORE than the people that is going to watch it.
* Please be open to receive questions and even criticism. Do NEVER reply harshly even if you receive a complain in the front of the audience. 
* ALWAYS be polite when talking to your audience.
* It is common that people will look for you with questions and more complex cases after your talk. Please consider it as a gift, it means that you represent something good for those people! 
* If you don't give enough attention to people after your talk, you will be very UNFAIR with the chance that was given to you for giving the talk. Please put yourself on their side before reacting.
