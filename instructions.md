# Instructions

Please follow the instructions here about giving a talk for the AC UI Bootcamp. Should you have any question or suggestion, please make sure you talk to your buddy.

## Steps

1. Get approval / confirmation from the buddies.
1. Pick a attractive, interesting title for your talk. If you can't think on a good name, please ask your buddy a suggestion.
1. Prepare the talk agenda in very clear and well-defined topics, and present it to your buddy.
1. Go and register this talk in AC Miles. Feel free to advertise your talk in the company as much as you want :)
1. Set up a Fuze meeting for your talk. If you don't have access, please ask your buddy for help.

## Content steps

1. Prepare the content in such way it will last no more than 50 minutes, leaving up to 10 minutes for questions.
1. Prepare a homework that should take up to 10 hours of work to be delivered. It should not be so easy to be completed in a day.
1. Think ahead on how will you correct the homeworks. If you think the work load is too heavy, please talk to your buddy so that you can look for some help from others.
1. Give at least 3 reference links to be followed for further studies.

## Slide deck standards

1. Make sure you have read the slide decks from some previous AC talks to better understand about how it should be.
1. You should have access to the company account at [Slid.es](https://slid.es/avenuecode). If you don't have it, please ask your buddy.
1. The easiest way to get the template is to fork a previous slide deck.
1. The 1st slide should always be the cover, featuring your lecture name, your name, the lecture date and AC logo.
1. The 2nd slide should always be the agenda, in topics.
1. Each time you have content from a same topic that doesn't fit on the slide, you should expand it VERTICALLY by adding a slide below.
1. Each time you have another topic, you should expand it HORIZONTALLY by adding a slide to the right.
1. The 3 last slides should always be: Conclusions, Learn more (with the reference links) and Homework.
1. Be welcome to try a different color/fonts scheme, as long as you keep the same template elements as: AC logo on the right bottom corner, line on the bottom, title below this line.

## Talk standards

1. Make sure you watched some previous AC talks to better understand about how to use your voice and conduct the talk.
1. Don't use slangs or bad words.
1. Be objective. Don't overexplain in such way you could cause confusion to your attendees. 
1. It is ok to joke around, but don't exaggerate.
1. It is ok bring very brief off-topic discussions, but only if it doesn't disturb the natural flow of your content.
1. Train your english speaking. You will be listened by people all around the globe.
1. Train your full talk at least once before your talk.
1. If you are going to use examples or live coding, make sure you have them all prepared beforehand.
