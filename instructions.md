# Instructions

Please follow the instructions here about giving a talk for the AC UI Bootcamp. Should you have any question or suggestion, please make sure you talk to your buddy.

## Steps

1. Get approval / confirmation from the buddies.
1. Pick a attractive, interesting title for your talk. If you can't think on a good name, please ask your buddy a suggestion.
1. Prepare the talk agenda in very clear and well-defined topics, and present it to your buddy.
1. Set up the time for your talk. You can pick max 1h time slot, which currently is 2pm-3pm (before SF starts) or 6pm-7pm (in SF lunch time).
1. Go and register this talk in AC Miles. Feel free to advertise your talk in the company as much as you want :)
1. Set up the a Fuze meeting for your talk. If you don't have access, please ask your buddy for help.
1. Ask on [ui.bootcamp@avenuecode.com](mailto:ui.bootcamp@avenuecode.com) to update our Github repo with your talk. Please provide your GitHub account.
1. Now you should start working on your slide deck, and as soon it is completed, please send an email to [ui.bootcamp@avenuecode.com](mailto:ui.bootcamp@avenuecode.com) with your slide deck link, so that we will fork it within Avenue Code's account.

## Content steps

1. Prepare the content in such way it will last no more than 50 minutes, leaving up to 10 minutes for questions.
1. Prepare a homework that should take up to 10 hours of work to be delivered. It should not be so easy to be completed in a day.
1. Think ahead on how will you correct the homeworks. If you think the work load is too heavy, please talk to your buddy so that you can look for some help from others.
1. The homework should be a problem that would be solved using things that were covered on the talk. It is ok to go a little bit far (forcing the attendee to do some research), but not much.
1. If appliable, it is recommended for the homework to be some problem that could be also used by the recruitment team. If that happens, we can create a small contest where the best solution will incorporate the recruitment material and the person who developed will receive a free lunch or some other prize.
1. Give at least 3 reference links to be followed for further studies.

## Slide deck standards

1. Sign up for a free account at [Slid.es](http://slid.es).
1. Fork any slide deck from [Avenue Code's slid.es account](https://slid.es/avenuecode) - this will create a copy of this talk in your personal account, which you can freely change. This approach is recommended because you will get the template featuring the footer with AC logo.
1. Make sure you have read some slide decks from previous AC talks to better understand about how it should be.
1. Be welcome to try a different color/fonts scheme, as long as you keep the same template elements as: AC logo on the right bottom corner, line on the bottom, title below this line.
1. If you prefer starting from scratch instead, make your template but please make sure open each slide's HTML source code and add on the bottom the following code to the get the footer with AC logo:

```
<div class="absolute-element" style="position: absolute; width: 719px; height: 46px; z-index: 4; left: 37px; 
  top: 596px; color: #ccc">
    <span>______________________________________________</span>
    <div style="text-align: left; font-size: 24px;">MY LECTURE TITLE GOES HERE</div>
</div>
<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/media-p.slid.es/uploads/avenuecode/images/197088/logo.png" class="absolute-element"
  style="position: absolute; max-height: none; max-width: none; width: 153px; height: 109px; z-index: 4; left: 757px; 
  top: 545px;">
```

## Slide deck organization

1. The 1st slide should always be the cover, featuring your lecture name, your name, the lecture date and AC logo.
1. The 2nd slide should always be the agenda, in topics.
1. From the 3rd slide on it should start your content.
1. Every time you have content from a same topic that doesn't fit on the slide, you should expand it VERTICALLY by adding a slide below.
1. Every time the next slide is about a different topic, you should expand it HORIZONTALLY by adding a slide to the right.
1. The 3 last slides should always be: Conclusions, Learn more (with the reference links) and Assignment.

## Talk standards

1. Be objective. Don't overexplain in such way you could cause confusion to your attendees. 
1. It is ok to joke around, but don't exaggerate.
